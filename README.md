# Better Sleeping #
This mod enhances the way sleeping works in Minecraft. You can go to sleep any time of the day provided you are tired.
You can also wake up any time of the day if you set an alarm clock right next to your bed.

## Modpacks ##
Feel free to use it any modpack as you wish.
The only thing I dislike is rehosting my mod on 3rd party websites. If you want to link my mod then link the Curse page, do NOT rehost it yourself. (Modpack rehosting is fine of course.)
